#### About me:
My love for programming started in high school. We then studied *QBasic* and *Turbo Pascal* and I liked it so much that I never missed a single school programming competition and was sure that programming was my whole life's work.

I am now 22 and have just completed my bachelor's degree in Nanoengineering. During my studies, I had several subjects related to writing code. So, over these 4 years, I: 
- created my first website on *HTML* and *CSS* and hosted it on github pages;
- implemented several algorithms in *python* to automate the solution of simple linear algebra problems and mathematical physics equations;
- implemented a model of a single-layer perceptron in *python* without any libraries; 
- studied the basics of *C* using it when performing tasks in computational mathematics;

In my last year, I realized that programming is still more to my liking than theoretical physics. That is why I decided to become a frontend developer. In total, 4 months have passed since I started training, and during this time I have studied a lot of technologies and continue to learn them deeper and simultaneously study new ones.

I am sure that the discipline in studying and the love for what I do will make me become a competent front-end developer
